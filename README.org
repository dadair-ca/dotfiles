This repository contains my personal system configuration.

It is pretty bare at the moment, but I plan to migrate my ad-hoc configuration to it over time.

** Getting Started
These dotfiles are managed using the [[https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/][GNU Stow]] utility, which needs to be installed on the system:

#+begin_quote
*NOTE*: If using a [[https://getfedora.org/][Fedora]] operating system, and the XDG configuration specification:
#+end_quote

#+begin_src sh
sudo dnf install stow
#+end_src

#+begin_quote
*NOTE*: If using a Mac operating system, and the XDG configuration specification:
#+end_quote

#+begin_src sh
sudo brew install stow
#+end_src

Once ~stow~ is installed, clone this repository into ~$HOME/.dotfiles~:
#+begin_src sh
git clone git@github.com:dadair-ca/dotfiles.git $HOME/.dotfiles
#+end_src

Since these are my personal dotfiles, it's assumed everything should be installed/stowed.
The directory structure of this repository reflects that assumption, and so these dotfiles can be installed simply by stowing from the root of the directory:
#+begin_src sh
cd $HOME/.dotfiles
stow .
#+end_src
