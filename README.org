This repository contains my personal system configuration.

It is pretty bare at the moment, but I plan to migrate my ad-hoc configuration to it over time.

** Getting Started
#+begin_quote
*NOTE*: assumes a [[https://getfedora.org/][Fedora]] operating system, and the XDG configuration specification
#+end_quote

These dotfiles are managed using the [[https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/][GNU Stow]] utility, which needs to be installed on the system:
#+begin_src sh
sudo dnf install stow
#+end_src

Once ~stow~ is installed, clone this repository into ~$HOME/.dotfiles~:
#+begin_src sh
git clone git@github.com:dadair-ca/dotfiles.git $HOME/.dotfiles
#+end_src

Finally, simply ~stow~ the dotfiles to install them:
#+begin_src sh
stow $HOME/.dotfiles
#+end_src
